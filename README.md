<h3>How It Works:</h3>
ClimaPredict collects data from various sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi 4. The DHT11 sensor provides temperature and humidity readings, the rain sensor detects precipitation, and the LDR sensor measures light intensity. This data is then processed by the Raspberry Pi to generate weather predictions for today and tomorrow. The results are displayed on the LCD screen, allowing users to view the forecasts in real time. The system operates wirelessly, making it an efficient and user-friendly solution for climate monitoring.
